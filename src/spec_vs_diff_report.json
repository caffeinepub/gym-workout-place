  "summary": "Diff adds a TanStack Router app shell with header/footer layout, reusable UI cards (program/pricing/trainer/testimonial), contact form and business info components wired to React Query hooks, and a Motoko backend actor with contact submission and business info query methods. Several key requirements cannot be verified due to omitted/truncated files (notably page implementations and static assets). Some backend/API pieces appear unrequested (trap methods for WhatsApp/call/maps).",

    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Smooth scrolling for in-page anchor navigation where applicable.",
      "reason": "No evidence of any smooth-scroll behavior (e.g., CSS scroll-behavior, scroll-to handlers) in the shown added files; only normal route navigation is present.",

      "id": "REQ-10",
      "requirement": "Persist contact form submissions in the backend actor.",
      "reason": "The backend defines `let submissions = List.empty<ContactSubmission>();` with no `stable` storage, and uses `submissions.add(newSubmission)` on a value that appears immutable; based on the shown code there is no clear persistent state mutation/retention across calls/upgrades.",
